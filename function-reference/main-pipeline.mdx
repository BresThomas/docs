- **Inputs:**
  - `llm`: An instance of the AI language model (`ChatOpenAI`).
  - `chosen_title`: The title selected from the generated options.

  - `content_folder`: The folder within the repository to store content.
  - `languages`: List of language codes for translation (includes "en" by default).

- **Process Overview:**
  1. **Slug Creation:** Converts the title into a URL-friendly slug.
  2. **Content Generation:**  
     - Generates an outline, initial draft, and SEO-optimized content.
     - Edits the draft for clarity and accuracy.
     - Generates an excerpt and a set of tags.
  3. **Translation:** Translates content into additional languages if specified.
  4. **Markdown Formatting:** Formats the final content with YAML front matter.
  5. **File Storage:** Saves the formatted content as markdown files.
  6. **URL Generation:** Constructs URLs for accessing the blog posts.

- **Output:** Returns a dictionary containing:
  - `slug`: The generated slug.
  - `outline`: The generated outline.
  - `final_draft`: The final edited content.
  - `created_files`: Paths to the saved markdown files.
  - `published_urls`: URLs for the published blog posts.

### `main`

The `main` function ties everything together by:
- Rendering a Streamlit UI to collect user input.
- Invoking the pipeline functions.
- Optionally committing and pushing changes to Git.

This modular design allows for easy customization or extension of the pipeline.
